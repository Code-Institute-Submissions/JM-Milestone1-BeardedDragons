## Project Goals
The core aim of the project is to provide consumers with a professional, appealing source of information about bearded dragons - an exotic lizard often kept as pets.

The secondary aim of the project is to act as a prototype for an affiliate marketing website, by funnelling Users who are looking to purchase pet equipment to relevant Amazon Store pages.

## UX
The target audience of the project are consumers with a variety of Goals:
* Those who seek general information about bearded dragons and how to buy one

### Design
The UI has been designed with style and intuition at its core. The design aims to elevate the appeal of the bearded dragon, through high quality images and detailed but easy-to-read information, and make the User journey as simple as possible.
* __Colour scheme__ - As a mainly informational site I chose to keep the colours neutral, adding light brown detail to match the most popular species of bearded dragon
* __Typography__ - not decided yet
* __Imagery__ - Every page has a unique background image relating to bearded dragons, and smaller images of bearded dragons are included in the navbar
